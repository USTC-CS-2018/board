On January 26, Prof. Hemin Cui from Hong Kong University(HKU) gave us a report about his laboratory and his recent work. After his wonderful speech, we have gained both a glimpse of his excellent laboratory and some knowledge of distributed system.

At the beginning, Prof. Cui briefly introduced his laboratory in HKU. According to Prof. Cui, his lab is dedicated to optimize the embedded systems, which is similar to Advanced Data Systems Laboratory in USTC. What’s more, Prof. Cui allows group members in his lab to select any research topic they want, which provides them with sufficient freedom to realize their potentials. Regarding the way to cultivate students, Prof. Cui is good at instructing students to gain knowledge and independence in research work. During his talk, Prof. Cui emphasized the significance of the originality of ideas. He believed that only by creating the idea independently can we make an innovative implementation. 

Later, Prof. Cui demonstrated his recent work of a distributed edge-computing database. In order to guarantee the serialization, current state-of-the-art distributed database has a considerable tail latency. In Prof. Cui’s work, he designed a prediction method to break the serialization when there is no collision. The statistics in the evaluation shows that this design can obviously reduce tail latency without sacrificing its throughput. Therefore, Prof. Cui’s work has a great optimization in performance.

During he speech, I was deeply fascinated by Prof. Cui’s strong scientific research level and unique way to instruct students. As a group interested in distributed systems, we should learn from those brilliant scholars and achieve more improvement in the future.
