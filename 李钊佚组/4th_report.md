### Professor Cui is committed to finding common ground between students' interests and Professor Cui's own expertise, say, operating system and distributed system, in order to determine the specific research topics of their group.
### Generally speaking, Professor Cui and his reasearch group are working on research topics related to distributed systems and operating systems.
### Specifically speaking, in recent years, They are working on Decentralized Distributed Internet Systems including Strong Anonymity in a Decentralized Network, Serialzable Transcations in Edge Computing, and Consensus for permissioned blockchains. Professor Cui said that these topics are strongly relevant to network attack and defense and network security. Meanwhile they are hammering at the security of systems in the cloud, including big data systems with strong privacy and differentially private big data mining system. More specifically, Professor Cui and his group are using high security hardware that already exists like Intel SGX and HUAWEI ARM TrustZone to build their own high security big data computing distributed systems and doing some work relevant to differential privacy. Besides, they are also exploring AI large-scale models pipeline training fields from the perspective of distributed systems. As for Operating System, Professor Cui and his group have been reasearching high performance and reliable virtual machine and storage system in cloud computing for a long time. Of course, this is also highly relevant to the topics which we have already mentioned above. Professor Cui gave us an example that so-called AI Large-scale models Parallel Pipeline Training is acutally a kind of Cloud Compuing Service. And Lastly Professor Cui mentioned that they also just start to do some works around operating system for robots.
